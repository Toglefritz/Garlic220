# Garlic220
The Garlic220 is an LED matrix for your NZXT H500 PC case featuring a 10 x 22 grid of WS2812B addressable LEDs (for 220 LEDs in total, hense the number in the name). The matrix, once mounted on a 3D printed frame with an acrylic diffuser, creates a grid of pixel-like lights. Using a bespoke Android app, the color of every pixel in the display can be controlled, allowing the Garlic220 to display any design you'd like.
